1.Overtemperature Interlock: Shutdown the turbine if the exhaust gas temperature exceeds a predefined limit (e.g., 650Â°C). This prevents thermal damage to turbine components such as blades, bearings, and seals.
2.Overspeed Interlock: Trigger an emergency stop if the turbine rotor speed exceeds its maximum operating threshold (e.g., 105% of nominal speed). This ensures the protection of mechanical components from excessive centrifugal forces and potential structural failure.
3.Overpressure Interlock: Open the pressure relief valve if the pressure in the combustion chamber exceeds safe levels (e.g., 30 bar). This action helps prevent damage or explosion caused by excessive pressure build-up.
4.Low Lubrication Pressure Interlock: Stop the turbine if lubrication oil pressure falls below the safe operating limit (e.g., 1.5 bar). Insufficient lubrication can lead to excessive wear on bearings and rotors, potentially causing catastrophic failure.
5.High Vibration Interlock: Shut down the turbine if excessive vibration is detected (e.g., vibration amplitude exceeds 10 mm/s). Excessive vibration can indicate issues such as misalignment, imbalance, or bearing wear, which could lead to severe damage if not addressed promptly.
6.Flame Failure Interlock: Immediately stop fuel flow and trigger an alarm if the flame in the combustion chamber extinguishes. This prevents the accumulation of unburned fuel, which poses a significant explosion risk.
7.Fuel Gas Pressure Low Interlock: Close the fuel valve and stop the turbine if the fuel gas pressure drops below the required minimum (e.g., 2 bar). Insufficient fuel pressure can result in poor combustion efficiency and potential damage to the turbine.
8.Cooling Water Flow Interlock: Shutdown the turbine if cooling water flow falls below the minimum safe flow rate (e.g., 200 L/min). Proper cooling is essential to prevent overheating of critical components such as bearings and seals.
9.Compressor Surge Interlock: Activate a bypass valve or reduce load if the compressor experiences a surge condition. A surge occurs when the airflow through the compressor reverses direction, which can cause significant damage to the compressor blades.
10.Emergency Stop Interlock: Provide a manual emergency stop button that immediately shuts down the turbine and isolates fuel supply in case of any critical malfunction. This allows for rapid intervention in unexpected situations to prevent further damage or potential hazards.
