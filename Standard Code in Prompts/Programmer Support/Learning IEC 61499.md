Introduction to IEC 61499

IEC 61499 is an international standard published by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) for the design and implementation of distributed embedded control systems. It is designed to address the challenges of creating software for networked control devices, particularly those found in industrial automation environments. For individuals familiar with IEC 61131-3, understanding IEC 61499 involves recognizing several key concepts that differ significantly from traditional PLC programming paradigms.

Key Concepts

Function Blocks: Similar to IEC 61131-3, IEC 61499 uses function blocks as the basic building blocks of control logic. However, in IEC 61499, function blocks are more powerful and flexible, allowing for the encapsulation of complex functionality and the management of communication and resource allocation.
Distributed Execution: Unlike IEC 61131-3, which typically operates on a single device or centralized controller, IEC 61499 supports a distributed execution model. Function blocks can be dynamically allocated to different devices in a network, allowing for optimized use of resources and redundancy.
Event-Driven Model: While IEC 61131-3 primarily operates on a cycle-by-cycle basis, IEC 61499 supports event-driven execution. This means that function blocks can be triggered by events such as changes in input values or messages received from other devices, leading to more responsive and efficient systems.
Communication: IEC 61499 defines a standard way of communicating between function blocks across different devices. This includes mechanisms for data exchange, synchronization, and coordination of distributed processes.
Resource Management: IEC 61499 introduces the concept of resources, which are entities that can be shared among function blocks. Resources can represent physical devices or logical entities that require coordinated access, such as databases or actuators.
Portability and Scalability: Due to its modular and distributed nature, IEC 61499 enables the creation of portable and scalable control systems. Function blocks can be reused across different projects and platforms, facilitating a higher degree of interoperability.
Comparison with IEC 61131-3

Architecture: IEC 61499 promotes a distributed architecture, whereas IEC 61131-3 typically follows a centralized approach. This means that IEC 61499 can better leverage the capabilities of modern networks and computing infrastructures.
Execution Model: While IEC 61131-3 executes programs in a fixed scan cycle, IEC 61499 supports asynchronous and event-driven execution, which can lead to more efficient use of processing power and faster response times.
Flexibility for Distributed Systems: IEC 61499's support for dynamic allocation of function blocks and resources makes it highly suitable for complex distributed control systems, offering greater flexibility in system configuration and maintenance.
