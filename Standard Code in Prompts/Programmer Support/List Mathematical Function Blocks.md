The OSCAT library, or Open Source Control Application Toolkit, provides a collection of reusable function blocks designed to simplify the development of control applications for programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Among these blocks are various mathematical function blocks that perform arithmetic operations, conversions, and other numerical computations essential for control systems.

Here is a detailed list of common mathematical function blocks that you might find in the OSCAT library or similar libraries used for PLC programming, along with brief descriptions of their functionality and typical use cases:

Arithmetic Function Blocks

Add (ADD)
Description: Adds two numbers together.
Use Case: Commonly used in summing inputs in feedback control systems.
Subtract (SUB)
Description: Subtracts one number from another.
Use Case: Useful for calculating differences, such as in error detection systems.
Multiply (MUL)
Description: Multiplies two numbers.
Use Case: Often used in scaling operations or calculating areas/volumes.
Divide (DIV)
Description: Divides one number by another.
Use Case: Used in rate calculations, such as flow rates or speed adjustments.
Power (POW)
Description: Raises one number to the power of another.
Use Case: Useful in exponential growth/decay models, such as in chemical reactions or population dynamics.
Square Root (SQRT)
Description: Computes the square root of a number.
Use Case: Common in physics equations, such as calculating velocity from acceleration.
Trigonometric Function Blocks

Sine (SIN)
Description: Calculates the sine of an angle.
Use Case: Used in wave generation, harmonic analysis, or robotic arm positioning.
Cosine (COS)
Description: Calculates the cosine of an angle.
Use Case: Similar to Sine but used in different phases of waveforms or vector calculations.
Tangent (TAN)

Use Case: Similar to ASIN but for calculating angles in certain geometrical problems.
Arctangent (ATAN)
Description: Calculates the inverse tangent of a number.
Use Case: Used in coordinate transformations or for calculating angles from slopes.
Conversion Function Blocks

Degrees to Radians (DEG_TO_RAD)
Description: Converts degrees to radians.
Use Case: Necessary for using trigonometric functions that expect radians as input.
Radians to Degrees (RAD_TO_DEG)
Description: Converts radians to degrees.
Use Case: Useful for displaying angular measurements in a more human-readable format.
Logical and Bit Manipulation Function Blocks

Absolute Value (ABS)
Description: Returns the absolute value of a number.
Use Case: Used to remove the sign of a value, such as in distance calculations.
Maximum (MAX)
Description: Returns the maximum of two or more numbers.
Use Case: Used in setting limits or selecting the highest value among options.
Minimum (MIN)
Description: Returns the minimum of two or more numbers.
Use Case: Used in setting limits or selecting the lowest value among options.
Bit Shift Left (BSHIFT_LEFT)
Description: Shifts bits to the left by a specified number of positions.
Use Case: Used in bit manipulation for scaling or encoding data.
Bit Shift Right (BSHIFT_RIGHT)
Description: Shifts bits to the right by a specified number of positions.

Miscellaneous Function Blocks

Logarithm (LOG)
Description: Calculates the logarithm of a number (base 10 or natural log).
Use Case: Used in exponential decay models or for scaling purposes.
Exponential (EXP)
Description: Calculates e raised to the power of a number.
Use Case: Used in growth models or for converting linear scales to exponential ones.
Modulo (MOD)
Description: Computes the remainder of a division.
Use Case: Useful for cycling through a range of values or implementing periodic behavior.
