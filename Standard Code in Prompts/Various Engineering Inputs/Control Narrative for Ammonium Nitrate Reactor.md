Control Narrative for Ammonium Nitrate Production Reactor

Section 1: Overview

Ammonium nitrate production involves the neutralization of nitric acid with ammonia gas to form ammonium nitrate solution, which is then processed into solid form. The process requires precise control of reactant ratios, temperature, and pressure to ensure a safe and efficient reaction.

Section 2: Reactor Preparation

Before starting the reaction, the reactor must be prepared and checked for leaks and safety integrity.

Pressure Check: Ensure the reactor is sealed and check for leaks at pressures up to 5 bar.
Temperature Check: Preheat the reactor to 50°C to facilitate the exothermic reaction.
Instrumentation Verification: Confirm that all sensors and control systems are calibrated and functioning correctly.
Section 3: Reactant Introduction

The introduction of reactants into the reactor must be carefully controlled to maintain the correct stoichiometry and prevent overheating.

Ammonia Flow Rate: Setpoint 50 kg/hour with a range of 45 to 55 kg/hour.
Nitric Acid Flow Rate: Setpoint 100 kg/hour with a range of 90 to 110 kg/hour.
Reactant Ratio: Maintain a molar ratio of NH₃ to HNO₃ of 1:1 to ensure complete neutralization.
Section 4: Reaction Control

During the reaction, it is crucial to maintain optimal conditions for the exothermic reaction.

Reaction Temperature: Setpoint 70°C with a range of 65°C to 75°C.
Cooling Water Flow Rate: Setpoint 150 L/min with a range of 140 to 160 L/min to manage heat release.
Pressure: Maintain pressure below 2 bar to prevent excessive stress on the reactor walls.
Agitation Speed: Setpoint 300 rpm with a range of 280 to 320 rpm to ensure homogenous mixing.
Section 5: Product Separation

Once the reaction is complete, the ammonium nitrate solution must be separated from any unreacted materials and purified.

Solution Temperature: Setpoint 80°C with a range of 75°C to 85°C for optimal crystallization.
Crystallizer Agitation: Setpoint 200 rpm with a range of 180 to 220 rpm to promote crystal growth.
Crystal Size: Target average crystal size of 0.5 mm with a range of 0.4 to 0.6 mm to ensure easy handling and uniformity.
Section 6: Drying and Packaging

The final step involves drying the ammonium nitrate crystals and packaging them for distribution.

Drying Temperature: Setpoint 110°C with a range of 105°C to 115°C to remove moisture without degrading the product.
Drying Time: Setpoint 3 hours with a range of 2.5 to 3.5 hours to ensure complete drying.
Product Moisture Content: Target moisture content below 0.5% to meet quality standards.
Section 7: Safety Considerations

Given the explosive nature of ammonium nitrate, safety measures must be strictly adhered to throughout the process.

Emergency Shutdown: Install automatic shutdown triggers for temperature above 80°C and pressure above 2.5 bar.
Ventilation System: Ensure the ventilation system is operational and capable of handling any accidental releases.
Explosion Suppression: Equip the reactor with explosion suppression systems and fire extinguishing equipment.
Regular Inspections: Conduct regular inspections and maintenance checks on all equipment to identify and rectify potential issues promptly.
