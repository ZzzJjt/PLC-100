**Interlock Cause & Effect Matrix:**

Develop a cause and effect matrix for the interlocks required in a chemical reactor system. Each row should represent a specific cause linked to sensor values such as pressure, temperature, or level, while each column should represent the corresponding effect related to actuator actions such as closing valves, stopping pumps, or triggering alarms. Once the matrix is complete, write a detailed explanation of how these interlocks ensure the safety and stability of the reactor operation. Discuss how each interlock action prevents hazardous conditions and safeguards the equipment during abnormal process situations.
