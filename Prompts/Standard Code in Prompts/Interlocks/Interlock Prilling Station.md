1.High Temperature Interlock: Shutdown the process if the temperature in the prilling tower exceeds a safe limit (e.g., 100°C). This prevents thermal degradation of AN and reduces the risk of decomposition, which could lead to explosive reactions.
2.Low Temperature Interlock: Alarm if the temperature drops below a minimum limit (e.g., 80°C). This ensures that the AN solution remains fluid enough to be sprayed properly and form uniform prills.
3.High Pressure Interlock: Close the feed valve if the pressure in the prilling tower rises above a safe level (e.g., 5 bar). This prevents overpressurization, which could cause structural damage to the tower or equipment.
4.Low Pressure Interlock: Alarm if the pressure drops below a minimum threshold (e.g., 2 bar). This indicates a possible blockage or failure in the supply lines, requiring immediate attention.
5.High Solution Concentration Interlock: Shutdown the solution pump if the concentration of the AN solution becomes too high (e.g., >95%). This prevents the formation of solid blocks in the tower and ensures proper prilling.
6.Low Solution Flow Rate Interlock: Shutdown the spray nozzles if the flow rate of the AN solution falls below a minimum level (e.g., 5 m³/h). This prevents the formation of large, irregular prills or clogging of the nozzles.
7.High Humidity Interlock: Alarm if the humidity inside the prilling tower exceeds a safe limit (e.g., 70%). High humidity can affect the quality of the prills and increase the risk of agglomeration.
8.Low Air Flow Interlock: Shutdown the air fans if the air flow rate through the prilling tower drops below a minimum threshold (e.g., 2000 m³/h). Adequate air flow is necessary to cool the prills and remove moisture.
9.High Dust Concentration Interlock: Alarm if the dust concentration inside the prilling tower exceeds a safe limit (e.g., 5 mg/m³). High dust levels can indicate issues with the prilling process or equipment and pose inhalation risks to personnel.
10.Emergency Stop Interlock: Provide a manual emergency stop button that immediately halts all process activities and isolates the system from the feedstock supply in the event of any critical malfunction.
11.Vapor Detection Interlock: Shutdown the system if vapor detectors identify the presence of hazardous gases (e.g., nitrogen oxides). This prevents the risk of fire or explosion due to gas accumulation.
12.Power Failure Interlock: Automatically engage a backup power source to maintain critical functions (e.g., air circulation, temperature control) during a power outage.
