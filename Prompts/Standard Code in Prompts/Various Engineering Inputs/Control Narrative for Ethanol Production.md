Control Narrative for Ethanol Production

Section 1: Overview

Ethanol production typically involves several key steps: raw material preparation, saccharification (conversion of starches to sugars), fermentation, and distillation. Precise control over temperature, pH, and nutrient levels ensures optimal yeast activity and ethanol yield.

Section 2: Raw Material Preparation

The preparation of raw materials includes milling, cooking, and liquefaction to break down complex carbohydrates into simpler sugars.

Milling Temperature: Setpoint 35°C with a range of 30°C to 40°C to optimize starch breakdown.
Cooking Temperature: Setpoint 95°C with a range of 90°C to 100°C to gelatinize starches.
Liquefaction Temperature: Setpoint 90°C with a range of 85°C to 95°C to activate enzymes for starch breakdown.
Section 3: Fermentation

Fermentation is the core process where yeast converts sugars into ethanol and carbon dioxide. The following setpoints and ranges are essential for efficient fermentation:

3.1 Yeast Activation

Before introducing yeast to the mash, it must be activated to ensure viability and activity.

Yeast Activation Temperature: Setpoint 35°C with a range of 30°C to 40°C to stimulate yeast metabolism.
Activation Time: Setpoint 30 minutes with a range of 20 to 40 minutes to ensure full activation.
3.2 Inoculation

Introducing the activated yeast into the fermentation vessel initiates the conversion of sugars to ethanol.

Initial Fermentation Temperature: Setpoint 30°C with a range of 28°C to 32°C to optimize yeast activity.
Yeast Concentration: Setpoint 0.05 g/L with a range of 0.04 to 0.06 g/L to maintain adequate yeast cell count.
3.3 Fermentation Monitoring

Continuous monitoring of fermentation parameters ensures optimal conditions throughout the process.

Fermentation Temperature: Setpoint 32°C with a range of 30°C to 34°C to maximize ethanol yield.
pH Control: Setpoint 4.5 with a range of 4.3 to 4.7 to prevent bacterial contamination.
Oxygen Level: Setpoint 0 ppm with a range of 0 to 5 ppm to maintain anaerobic conditions.
3.4 Nutrient Addition

Supplementing the mash with nutrients can enhance yeast health and fermentation efficiency.

Nutrient Concentration: Setpoint 0.1 g/L with a range of 0.08 to 0.12 g/L to provide sufficient yeast nutrition.
Addition Timing: Introduce nutrients at the beginning of fermentation to support yeast growth.
3.5 Carbon Dioxide Removal

Excess CO₂ must be vented to prevent pressure buildup and maintain optimal fermentation conditions.

CO₂ Venting Rate: Setpoint 2 L/min with a range of 1.5 to 2.5 L/min to manage CO₂ levels.
Pressure Relief Valve: Setpoint 1 bar with a range of 0.9 to 1.1 bar to prevent overpressure.
3.6 Fermentation Completion

Determining when fermentation is complete is critical to prevent over-fermentation and ensure maximum ethanol yield.

Ethanol Concentration: Setpoint 10% (v/v) with a range of 9% to 11% (v/v) to indicate fermentation completion.
Residual Sugar Level: Setpoint 1 g/L with a range of 0.5 to 1.5 g/L to confirm minimal sugar remains.
