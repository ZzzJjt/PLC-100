**Shutdown Steel Production:**

Develop a comprehensive list of steps for the controlled shutdown of a steel production facility. Include key stages such as reducing furnace temperature, controlling gas flow rates, and maintaining safe oxygen levels throughout the shutdown process.

Provide a detailed control narrative for steps 4 to 6 of the shutdown sequence, specifying concrete ranges and setpoints for variables such as temperature, gas flow, and oxygen levels.

Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program based on this control narrative, ensuring proper sequencing and safety protocols.

Additionally, create a function in IEC 61131-3 to gradually reduce the fuel gas flow rate to the furnace burners over a period of 12 hours. This function should incorporate timing and safety checks to ensure smooth transitions.

Lastly, write an IEC 61131-3 function for adjusting the oxygen supply to the burners to maintain a precise fuel-to-air ratio of 1:2.5 during the shutdown. Ensure the function is adaptable to fluctuations in gas flow and temperature, and include safeguards for maintaining combustion efficiency.
