**Batch Polyethylene:**

Develop a self-contained program in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to implement batch control for a polyethylene production process. The program should cover the full production cycle, including the following steps: raw material preparation, polymerization, quenching, drying, pelletizing, quality control, and packaging and storage. Ensure that each step is clearly defined and appropriately sequenced with transitions, and provide detailed comments explaining the logic and control conditions for each phase. Discuss the challenges of integrating batch control into a PLC environment, including timing, resource allocation, and synchronization across multiple production units.
