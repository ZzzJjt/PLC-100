**Pick-and-Place Application for a Robot Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a PLC program in structured text (ST) according to IEC 61131-3 standards for a pick-and-place robotic application with two conveyors, following the process described below:

Process Description:

The system operates in two modes: Manual Mode and Auto Mode. These modes are interlocked, meaning only one can be active at any time.

	1.	Manual Mode:
	•	When the Manual button is pressed, the robotic arm will execute the following steps in response to individual manual commands:
	•	Clip: Clip the product from conveyor A.
	•	Transfer: Move the product to conveyor B.
	•	Release: Release the product onto conveyor B, allowing it to be carried away.
	2.	Auto Mode:
	•	When the Auto button is pressed, the robotic arm will execute the entire pick-and-place process automatically:
	•	Clip: Clip the product from conveyor A and hold it.
	•	Transfer: Transfer the product to conveyor B (this action takes 2 seconds).
	•	Release: Release the product onto conveyor B.
	•	The auto process completes after one cycle, but can be re-triggered by pressing the Auto button again.

The system should ensure that manual and auto modes cannot operate simultaneously, using interlocking logic to prevent conflicts between the two modes.
