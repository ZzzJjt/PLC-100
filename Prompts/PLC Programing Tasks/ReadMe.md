Write a PLC program in structured text (ST) according to IEC 61131-3 standards to control an automatic car wash station with a single wash bay. The system should use a sensor to detect the presence of a car. Once the car is detected and no human is present in the wash area, the system should initiate the car wash process. If a human is detected within the car wash area at any point, the station should immediately stop the wash process, trigger an alarm, and remain in a safe state until the area is clear.

**7.Entry/Exit Control for Underground Car Park Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a PLC program in structured text (ST) according to IEC 61131-3 to control the entry and exit of an underground car park. The system uses the following sensors and actuators:

	•	Sensors:
	•	X1: Photoelectric switch at the ground floor entry/exit. It will be ON when a car passes.
	•	X2: Photoelectric switch at the basement entry/exit. It will be ON when a car passes.
	•	M1: ON for one scan cycle when a car from the ground floor passes X1.
	•	M2: ON for one scan cycle when a car from the basement passes X1.
	•	M3: ON for one scan cycle when a car from the basement passes X2.
	•	M4: ON for one scan cycle when a car from the ground floor passes X2.
	•	Intermediate Variables:
	•	M20: ON during the process of a car entering the passage from the ground floor.
	•	M30: ON during the process of a car entering the passage from the basement.
	•	Output Devices:
	•	Y1: Red lights at the entry/exit of the ground floor and the basement.
	•	Y2: Green lights at the entry/exit of the ground floor and the basement.

Process Description:

The entry and exit of the underground car park is controlled by a single lane passage, with traffic lights regulating car movement. The red lights (Y1) prohibit cars from entering or leaving, while the green lights (Y2) allow movement.

	•	When a car enters the passage from the ground floor entry, the red lights at both the ground floor and basement turn ON, while the green lights turn OFF, preventing any other cars from entering or leaving until the car passes through the passage.
	•	Similarly, when a car enters from the basement, the red lights will turn ON at both entry points, prohibiting other vehicles from entering or leaving until the car passes through.
	•	When the passage is clear, the green lights will turn ON again, allowing cars to enter or exit freely.
	•	Initially, the PLC should set the green lights ON and the red lights OFF to indicate free movement.

**8.Pick-and-Place Application for a Robot Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a PLC program in structured text (ST) according to IEC 61131-3 standards for a pick-and-place robotic application with two conveyors, following the process described below:

Process Description:

The system operates in two modes: Manual Mode and Auto Mode. These modes are interlocked, meaning only one can be active at any time.

	1.	Manual Mode:
	•	When the Manual button is pressed, the robotic arm will execute the following steps in response to individual manual commands:
	•	Clip: Clip the product from conveyor A.
	•	Transfer: Move the product to conveyor B.
	•	Release: Release the product onto conveyor B, allowing it to be carried away.
	2.	Auto Mode:
	•	When the Auto button is pressed, the robotic arm will execute the entire pick-and-place process automatically:
	•	Clip: Clip the product from conveyor A and hold it.
	•	Transfer: Transfer the product to conveyor B (this action takes 2 seconds).
	•	Release: Release the product onto conveyor B.
	•	The auto process completes after one cycle, but can be re-triggered by pressing the Auto button again.

The system should ensure that manual and auto modes cannot operate simultaneously, using interlocking logic to prevent conflicts between the two modes.

**9.Empty Bottle Removal for Packaging Line Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text (ST) program to automate the removal of empty bottles in a packaging line. After bottles are filled, they are transported by a conveyor toward the packaging station. The system includes two proximity sensors: one detects the presence of any bottle, and the second detects only empty bottles. When an empty bottle is detected, a pneumatic cylinder is activated to remove the empty bottle from the conveyor before it reaches the packaging area.

Ensure that the program controls the conveyor and cylinder operations efficiently, preventing any empty bottles from continuing to the packaging process, while maintaining smooth operation for filled bottles.

**10.Coffee Maker Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text (ST) program to control a coffee machine that manages three tanks (coffee, milk, and mixer) and three valves (one for coffee, one for milk, and one for output). The machine should mix coffee and milk properly to create the best output, following this process:

System Description:

	1.	Tanks and Valves:
	•	The coffee and milk valves open to fill the mixer tank. The mixer tank can hold up to 130ml, and when it reaches the maximum level, the coffee and milk valves will close.
	2.	Mixing Process:
	•	Once the tank is full, the mixer starts automatically and runs for 4 seconds. After mixing is complete, the output valve opens to dispense the coffee.
	3.	Control Buttons:
	•	Button 1: Emergency Stop — Stops the entire system instantly in case of malfunction, such as valve failures, tank level issues, or mixer failures.
	•	Button 2: Start — Begins the coffee-making process.
	•	Button 3: Coffee and Milk — Prepares coffee with milk by opening both the coffee and milk valves.
	•	Button 4: Coffee Only — Prepares coffee without milk by only opening the coffee valve.

Safety Features:

	•	Implement the emergency stop to handle unexpected events, such as valve malfunctions, tank level detection failures, or mixer operation failures. When triggered, the system should stop immediately to ensure safety.
