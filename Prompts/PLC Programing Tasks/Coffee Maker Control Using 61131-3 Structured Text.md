**Coffee Maker Control Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text (ST) program to control a coffee machine that manages three tanks (coffee, milk, and mixer) and three valves (one for coffee, one for milk, and one for output). The machine should mix coffee and milk properly to create the best output, following this process:

System Description:

	1.	Tanks and Valves:
	•	The coffee and milk valves open to fill the mixer tank. The mixer tank can hold up to 130ml, and when it reaches the maximum level, the coffee and milk valves will close.
	2.	Mixing Process:
	•	Once the tank is full, the mixer starts automatically and runs for 4 seconds. After mixing is complete, the output valve opens to dispense the coffee.
	3.	Control Buttons:
	•	Button 1: Emergency Stop — Stops the entire system instantly in case of malfunction, such as valve failures, tank level issues, or mixer failures.
	•	Button 2: Start — Begins the coffee-making process.
	•	Button 3: Coffee and Milk — Prepares coffee with milk by opening both the coffee and milk valves.
	•	Button 4: Coffee Only — Prepares coffee without milk by only opening the coffee valve.

Safety Features:

	•	Implement the emergency stop to handle unexpected events, such as valve malfunctions, tank level detection failures, or mixer operation failures. When triggered, the system should stop immediately to ensure safety.
