**Artificial Neural Network Control for Temperature Regulation in a Chemical Reactor Using Python:**

Develop Python code to implement an artificial neural network (ANN) for advanced process control of the temperature in a chemical reactor. The control system should leverage the predictive and adaptive capabilities of ANNs to manage the reactor’s temperature, considering the nonlinear and time-varying nature of the reactor’s dynamics. Train the ANN using historical process data to optimize temperature control, ensuring stability and efficiency under varying operational conditions.

Implement Python code to simulate the chemical reactor’s temperature control dynamics and demonstrate how ANN-based control can outperform traditional methods in handling complex, nonlinear systems.
