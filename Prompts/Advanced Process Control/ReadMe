**MATLAB Distillation Column Modeling and Control:**

Develop MATLAB code for a mathematical model of a distillation column, capturing its dynamic relationships between feed rates and temperature. Avoid plotting results.

Implement a model predictive control (MPC) scheme using the developed model to optimize the distillation process while considering operational constraints.
