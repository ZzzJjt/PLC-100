**CANOpen PDO Registration Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a structured text (ST) function block named CAN_REGISTER_COBID based on IEC 61131 standards. The block will be responsible for registering or deleting a PDO (Process Data Object) or CAN Layer 2 message for reception by the network layer. When the REGISTER input is set to TRUE, the specified COBID (CAN identifier) will be registered for receiving messages. If REGISTER is set to FALSE, the registration of the respective COBID will be deleted. Additionally, when REGISTER is FALSE and COBID is set to 0, all registrations and messages stored in the network layer buffer will be cleared. Discuss the function blockâ€™s implementation, including error handling, network communication management, and memory buffer clearing mechanisms.
