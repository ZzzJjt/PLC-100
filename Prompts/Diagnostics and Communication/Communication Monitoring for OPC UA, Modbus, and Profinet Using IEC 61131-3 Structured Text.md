**Communication Monitoring for OPC UA, Modbus, and Profinet Using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a function block in structured text (ST) as per IEC 61131-3 standards to monitor communication connections to an OPC UA server, Modbus server, and Profinet in a machine system. The function block should continuously check the connection status of each protocol, and if any connection fails, an alarm should be triggered. Additionally, when a connection is lost, an entry must be created in the audit trail, detailing the reason for the server being down along with the corresponding error code. Discuss the implementation logic for monitoring multiple protocols, error detection, and how to effectively manage and log communication failures for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.
