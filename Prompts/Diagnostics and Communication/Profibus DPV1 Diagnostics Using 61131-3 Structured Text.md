**Profibus DPV1 Diagnostics Using 61131-3 Structured Text:**

Develop a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program to retrieve diagnostic data from a Profibus device using the Profibus DPV1 protocol. The program should implement a CASE statement to handle 10 specific diagnostic data types, such as communication errors, device status, and parameter faults. Each diagnostic type should be mapped to a concrete data type, ensuring that the retrieved information is processed accurately and efficiently. Discuss the logic behind handling these diagnostic data types, including error detection and fault handling mechanisms, to ensure robust communication with the Profibus device.
