**Linear Interpolation:**

Create a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute linear interpolation between two points. Ensure the function block is designed for general use, with detailed comments explaining the mathematical formula behind the interpolation process. Discuss considerations for precision and potential rounding errors, as well as the function blockâ€™s suitability for use in industrial control systems where real-time responsiveness is critical.
