Overview

This Structured Text (ST) program, UreaReactionControl, automates the urea synthesis process by controlling the opening and closing of ammonia and carbon dioxide (CO2) valves. The program ensures that the reactor reaches and maintains the required conditions (pressure and temperature) for the urea synthesis reaction to take place. After the reaction period, the valves are closed, and the process is marked as completed.

Program Structure

The program is organized into sections for inputs, outputs, internal variables, parameters, and the main sequence control logic.

Inputs

stAmmoniaValve (BOOL): Indicates whether the ammonia valve is open (TRUE) or closed (FALSE).
stCO2Valve (BOOL): Indicates whether the CO2 valve is open (TRUE) or closed (FALSE).
rCurrentPressure (REAL): Current pressure in the reactor in bars.
rCurrentTemperature (REAL): Current temperature in the reactor in degrees Celsius.
Outputs

stAmmoniaValveControl (BOOL): Signal to control the ammonia valve. TRUE indicates the valve should be opened, FALSE indicates it should be closed.
stCO2ValveControl (BOOL): Signal to control the CO2 valve. TRUE indicates the valve should be opened, FALSE indicates it should be closed.
Internal Variables

stStep1 (BOOL): Flag indicating the completion of step 1 (loading raw materials).
stStep2 (BOOL): Flag indicating the completion of step 2 (controlling the reaction).
stReactionFinished (BOOL): Flag indicating the completion of the entire reaction process.
Parameters

rTargetPressure (REAL): Target pressure for the reactor in bars.
rPressureTolerance (REAL): Allowed deviation from the target pressure in bars.
rTargetTemperature (REAL): Target temperature for the reactor in degrees Celsius.
rTemperatureTolerance (REAL): Allowed deviation from the target temperature in degrees Celsius.
tReactionTime (TIME): Total time allowed for the reaction in minutes.
tReactionTimer (TIME): Timer to track the progress of the reaction.
Main Sequence Control

The main sequence control is structured as a series of steps that ensure the reaction conditions are met and maintained until the reaction is complete.

Step 1: Load Raw Materials
Open both the ammonia and CO2 valves (stAmmoniaValveControl := TRUE and stCO2ValveControl := TRUE).
Check the status of the valves (IF stAmmoniaValve AND stCO2Valve THEN). If both valves are open, set the flag stStep1 := TRUE and record the current time (tReactionTimer := CURRENT_TIME) to start the reaction timing.
Step 2: Control Reaction
Check if the current pressure and temperature are within the target range (IF (rCurrentPressure >= rTargetPressure - rPressureTolerance) AND (rCurrentPressure <= rTargetPressure + rPressureTolerance) AND (rCurrentTemperature >= rTargetTemperature - rTemperatureTolerance) AND (rCurrentTemperature <= rTargetTemperature + rTemperatureTolerance)).
If the conditions are met, check if the reaction time has been reached (IF CURRENT_TIME >= tReactionTimer + tReactionTime). If so, set the flag stStep2 := TRUE to proceed to the next step.
If the conditions are not met, adjust the valves based on the pressure and temperature (stAmmoniaValveControl := (rCurrentPressure < rTargetPressure) OR (rCurrentTemperature < rTargetTemperature) and stCO2ValveControl := (rCurrentPressure < rTargetPressure) OR (rCurrentTemperature < rTargetTemperature)).
Completion of Reaction
Close all valves (stAmmoniaValveControl := FALSE and stCO2ValveControl := FALSE) and mark the reaction as finished (stReactionFinished := TRUE).
Notes

The program assumes continuous monitoring of the reactor's pressure and temperature. Any updates to these values should trigger a reevaluation of the current step and potentially lead to changes in the valve control signals.
The program uses the CURRENT_TIME function to manage the timing of the reaction steps. This function should return the current system time or a time stamp that is updated regularly.
The logic for adjusting the valves is based on the principle that additional reactants are needed if the pressure or temperature falls below the target values. More sophisticated control strategies may be required for precise regulation, especially in industrial settings where safety and efficiency are critical.
