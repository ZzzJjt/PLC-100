Explanation of Interlock Safety Mechanisms

1. High Reactor Pressure (> 200 psi)

	•	Effects: Opens the pressure relief valve, closes the feed valve, stops the reactor agitator, activates a high-pressure alarm, and triggers an emergency shutdown.
	•	Purpose: High reactor pressure is a critical safety concern, as it can lead to ruptures or explosions. The interlock actions immediately relieve pressure, stop reactant flow, and halt mechanical agitation to prevent further pressure build-up. Emergency shutdown ensures the reactor reaches a safe state.

2. Low Reactor Pressure (< 50 psi)

	•	Effects: Closes the feed valve, stops cooling water flow, and activates a low-pressure alarm.
	•	Purpose: Low pressure in the reactor may indicate a leak or vacuum conditions, which can cause cavitation in pumps or improper mixing. The interlocks prevent feed introduction to an unstable system and stop cooling to avoid temperature imbalances.

3. High Reactor Temperature (> 300°C)

	•	Effects: Closes the steam valve, opens the cooling water valve, stops the feed pump, activates a high-temperature alarm, and triggers an emergency shutdown.
	•	Purpose: Excessively high temperatures can cause unwanted reactions or thermal degradation of reactants. The interlocks remove the heat source, add cooling, and stop reactant addition to control the temperature and prevent hazardous conditions.

4. Low Reactor Temperature (< 100°C)

	•	Effects: Closes the cooling water valve, opens the steam valve, and activates a low-temperature alarm.
	•	Purpose: Low temperatures may indicate insufficient heat input, leading to incomplete reactions or product loss. The interlock restores heating and reduces cooling to bring the temperature back within operational limits.

5. High Liquid Level (> 90%)

	•	Effects: Closes the feed valve, stops the feed pump, activates a high-level alarm, and triggers an emergency shutdown.
	•	Purpose: High liquid levels in the reactor can cause overflows, equipment damage, and unsafe working conditions. The interlock prevents more feed from entering the reactor and stops the pump to reduce the risk of spillage or flooding.

6. Low Liquid Level (< 10%)

	•	Effects: Closes the cooling water valve, closes the steam valve, activates a low-level alarm, and stops the agitator.
	•	Purpose: Low liquid levels can expose reactor internals, causing damage, poor mixing, or overheating. The interlock actions stop agitation and heating to protect the reactor and ensure safe operation.

7. Reactor Overpressure (>= 250 psi)

	•	Effects: Opens the emergency vent valve, closes all valves, stops all pumps, triggers an overpressure alarm, and initiates an emergency shutdown.
	•	Purpose: Overpressure is a critical emergency that can lead to catastrophic failure. The interlock relieves pressure through the emergency vent, isolates all inputs, and stops all pumps to prevent escalation.

8. Reactor Coolant Flow Low (< 5 m³/h)

	•	Effects: Stops the reactor agitator, closes the steam valve, and activates a low coolant flow alarm.
	•	Purpose: Insufficient coolant flow can cause overheating and thermal runaway. The interlock actions stop heating and agitation to prevent dangerous temperature increases.

9. Agitator Motor Fault

	•	Effects: Stops all reactant feeds, stops cooling water flow, activates an agitator fault alarm, and triggers an emergency shutdown.
	•	Purpose: Agitator failure can cause poor mixing and unstable reaction conditions. The interlock prevents further reactant addition and ensures the reactor enters a safe state until the issue is resolved.

10. Reactor Outlet Temperature High (> 350°C)

	•	Effects: Opens the cooling water valve, stops the feed pump, activates a high outlet temperature alarm, and triggers an emergency shutdown.
	•	Purpose: High outlet temperatures may indicate an uncontrolled exothermic reaction. The interlock actions cool the system and halt reactant flow to contain the situation.

11. Reactor Cooling Water Inlet Temperature High (> 60°C)

	•	Effects: Closes the steam valve, opens the bypass valve, and activates a high inlet temperature alarm.
	•	Purpose: High inlet cooling water temperatures reduce the cooling capacity, causing temperature imbalances. The interlock actions optimize heat balance and protect against temperature spikes.
