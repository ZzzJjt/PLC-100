**IEC 61131-3 Structured Text Program: Distillation Column Interlocks**

The following structured text program implements the safety interlocks for the distillation column described above. It continuously monitors critical parameters such as pressure, temperature, and liquid level, triggering appropriate actions when preset high or low limits are exceeded.

Role of Interlocks in Distillation Column Safety

Interlocks in a distillation column play a critical role in maintaining safe operating conditions by ensuring that the system responds automatically to abnormal situations. The key functions of interlocks include:

	**1.	Overpressure Protection:**
	•	Prevents the distillation column from exceeding design pressure limits, which could otherwise lead to equipment damage or rupture.
	•	Pressure relief interlocks (e.g., opening the pressure relief valve) immediately alleviate high pressure to prevent hazardous conditions.
	**2.	Temperature Control:**
	•	Monitors reboiler temperature to avoid overheating, which can degrade product quality and pose a risk of thermal decomposition or ignition.
	•	Automatically shuts off the reboiler heat supply if the temperature exceeds the safe limit.
	**3.	Level Management:**
	•	Maintains liquid level within the desired range, preventing column flooding or vapor flow disruption.
	•	Shuts off the feed supply if the liquid level is too high, ensuring the column operates within safe constraints.
	**4.	Process Stability and Reliability:**
	•	Interlocks help maintain process stability by ensuring that critical parameters are continuously monitored and controlled.
	•	Prevents process upsets that can propagate through interconnected units, affecting overall plant stability.
	**5.	Protecting Personnel and Equipment:**
	•	By implementing safety interlocks, the distillation column system minimizes risks to personnel and equipment, ensuring safe and reliable operation.
