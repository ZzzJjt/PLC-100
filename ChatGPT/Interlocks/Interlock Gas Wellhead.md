Below is the implementation of an emergency interlock system for a subsea gas wellhead using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. The program monitors critical parameters such as wellhead pressure, temperature, and flow rates using appropriate transmitters. If any of these parameters exceed predefined safety limits, it initiates an emergency shutdown by closing the master valve (MV-101). It also includes logic for manual reset requirements to prevent automatic restarts after an emergency shutdown, ensuring that the system can only be restarted by a human operator.

**Program Explanation**

	1.	Input Variables:
	•	WellheadPressure: Monitors the current pressure at the subsea wellhead.
	•	WellheadTemperature: Monitors the current temperature at the wellhead.
	•	WellheadFlowRate: Monitors the flow rate through the wellhead, detecting potential leaks.
	•	MasterValveCommand: Command input to open or close the master valve (MV-101).
	•	ManualReset: Input to manually reset the system after an emergency shutdown.
	2.	Output Variables:
	•	MasterValveStatus: Indicates whether the master valve is open (TRUE) or closed (FALSE).
	•	EmergencyShutdown: Indicates if an emergency shutdown has been triggered (TRUE).
	3.	Constant Safety Limits:
	•	HighPressureLimit: Maximum allowable wellhead pressure (1500 psi). Exceeding this value triggers an emergency shutdown.
	•	LowFlowLimit: Minimum flow rate through the wellhead (10 m³/h). A drop below this limit indicates a potential leak.
	•	HighTemperatureLimit: Maximum allowable wellhead temperature (120°C). Exceeding this value triggers an emergency shutdown.
	4.	Interlock Logic:
	•	The program continuously monitors the wellhead pressure, temperature, and flow rate.
	•	If any of these parameters exceed the predefined safety limits, the interlock system initiates an emergency shutdown by setting EmergencyShutdown to TRUE and closing the master valve (MV-101).
	•	When in an emergency shutdown state, the master valve remains closed, and no further operation is permitted until the condition is manually reset.
	5.	Manual Reset Requirement:
	•	Once the EmergencyShutdown is triggered, the system requires a manual reset (ManualReset := TRUE) to clear the emergency state.
	•	This prevents the interlock from automatically resetting, ensuring that human intervention is required to verify safe conditions before restarting the system.
