Here’s an IEC 61131-3 structured text (ST) function block for multiplying two 4x4 matrices. This block reads two 4x4 matrices as inputs and outputs their product matrix.

```
FUNCTION_BLOCK FB_MatrixMultiplication
    (* Input matrices A and B, and output matrix C, each defined as 4x4 arrays of REAL type *)
    VAR_INPUT
        Matrix_A: ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL; (* First input matrix *)
        Matrix_B: ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL; (* Second input matrix *)
    END_VAR

    VAR_OUTPUT
        Matrix_C: ARRAY[1..4, 1..4] OF REAL; (* Output matrix (result of Matrix_A * Matrix_B) *)
    END_VAR

    VAR
        i, j, k: INT; (* Loop counters *)
        TempSum: REAL; (* Temporary variable to store the sum of products for each element in Matrix_C *)
    END_VAR

(* Main function block logic for matrix multiplication *)
    FOR i := 1 TO 4 DO
        FOR j := 1 TO 4 DO
            TempSum := 0; (* Reset temporary sum for the new element *)
            FOR k := 1 TO 4 DO
                TempSum := TempSum + (Matrix_A[i, k] * Matrix_B[k, j]); (* Multiply and accumulate the product for the element *)
            END_FOR;
            Matrix_C[i, j] := TempSum; (* Store the computed element in the result matrix *)
        END_FOR;
    END_FOR;

END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```
**Explanation:**

	1.	Input Matrices: Matrix_A and Matrix_B are 4x4 arrays of REAL type, representing the two input matrices.
	2.	Output Matrix: Matrix_C is the 4x4 output matrix where the result of Matrix_A * Matrix_B is stored.
	3.	Temporary Variables:
	•	TempSum is used to accumulate the sum of the product for each element in the resulting matrix.
	•	Loop counters i, j, and k are used to iterate through rows and columns of the matrices.
	4.	Matrix Multiplication Logic:
	•	The nested loops iterate through the indices of matrices Matrix_A and Matrix_B to calculate each element of the result matrix Matrix_C.
	•	The outer loop (i) controls the row index of Matrix_A.
	•	The middle loop (j) controls the column index of Matrix_B.
	•	The inner loop (k) performs the dot product for the corresponding row of Matrix_A and column of Matrix_B.
