Here’s a sample IEC 61131-3 structured text function block for computing the sine of a given angle in radians. This function block leverages the Taylor series expansion to approximate the sine value, making it suitable for applications that do not have built-in trigonometric functions.

```
FUNCTION_BLOCK FB_Sine
    (* Input and output variables *)
    VAR_INPUT
        Angle_Radians: REAL; (* Input angle in radians *)
    END_VAR

    VAR_OUTPUT
        Sine_Value: REAL; (* Output: computed sine value *)
    END_VAR

    VAR
        Term: REAL; (* Current term in Taylor series *)
        Sum: REAL; (* Accumulated sum of terms *)
        Power: REAL; (* Power of the input angle *)
        Factorial: REAL; (* Factorial value for each term *)
        i: INT; (* Loop counter for number of terms *)
        Sign: INT; (* Alternating sign for terms in Taylor series *)
    END_VAR

(* Initialize variables *)
    Sum := 0; (* Reset the sum to 0 *)
    Term := Angle_Radians; (* First term of Taylor series is the angle itself *)
    Power := Angle_Radians; (* Initialize power to the input angle *)
    Factorial := 1; (* Initialize factorial to 1 *)
    Sign := 1; (* The first term is positive *)

(* Taylor series approximation for sine: Sum = x - (x^3)/3! + (x^5)/5! - (x^7)/7! + ... *)
    FOR i := 1 TO 10 DO
        Sum := Sum + (Sign * Term); (* Add or subtract the current term *)
        Power := Power * Angle_Radians * Angle_Radians; (* Compute the next power: x^(2n+1) *)
        Factorial := Factorial * (2 * i) * (2 * i + 1); (* Compute factorial: (2n+1)! *)
        Term := Power / Factorial; (* Calculate the next term in the series *)
        Sign := -Sign; (* Alternate the sign for the next term *)
    END_FOR;

    Sine_Value := Sum; (* Assign the final sum to the output value *)

END_FUNCTION_BLOCK

Explanation:

	1.	Input Variable:
	•	Angle_Radians: Represents the input angle in radians for which the sine value is to be computed.
	2.	Output Variable:
	•	Sine_Value: Contains the computed sine value of the input angle.
	3.	Local Variables:
	•	Term: Stores the current term in the Taylor series expansion.
	•	Sum: Accumulates the sum of the Taylor series terms.
	•	Power: Keeps track of the power of the angle, which is updated for each new term.
	•	Factorial: Calculates the factorial value for each term in the series.
	•	i: Loop counter used to control the number of terms in the series.
	•	Sign: Alternates between positive and negative for each subsequent term.
