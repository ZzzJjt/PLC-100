Implementing a full cubic spline interpolation in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text is complex due to the need for matrix operations and solving systems of linear equations. Below is a simplified implementation of natural cubic spline interpolation for a small set of data points, where the spline coefficients are pre-computed and used to interpolate values. The function block is designed to be modular and scalable, suitable for real-time applications where smooth curve fitting is required.

This example uses natural cubic spline interpolation with a fixed set of 5 data points. Extending this approach for a larger dataset involves managing matrix equations for coefficient calculation.
