Here’s an implementation of a self-contained timer function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. This function block includes configurable time duration, start/stop controls, and timeout handling.

```
FUNCTION_BLOCK FB_Timer
VAR_INPUT
    Start      : BOOL;  // Start the timer
    Stop       : BOOL;  // Stop the timer
    Duration   : TIME;  // Configurable timer duration (e.g., T#5s for 5 seconds)
END_VAR

VAR_OUTPUT
    Elapsed    : BOOL;  // Indicates whether the timer has elapsed
    TimeLeft   : TIME;  // Remaining time before the timer elapses
END_VAR

VAR
    TimerActive  : BOOL;   // Indicates if the timer is running
    StartTime    : TIME;   // Stores the time when the timer started
    CurrentTime  : TIME;   // Current system time
    TimeElapsed  : TIME;   // Elapsed time since the timer started
END_VAR

VAR_TEMP
    PreviousStart : BOOL;  // Previous state of the Start input
END_VAR

// Timer logic
IF Start AND NOT PreviousStart THEN
    // Start the timer when Start signal rises
    TimerActive := TRUE;
    StartTime := TIME();   // Capture the current time as the start time
    Elapsed := FALSE;
ELSIF Stop THEN
    // Stop the timer when Stop signal is TRUE
    TimerActive := FALSE;
    Elapsed := FALSE;
    TimeLeft := Duration;  // Reset TimeLeft to the full duration
END_IF;

IF TimerActive THEN
    // Calculate the elapsed time and remaining time
    CurrentTime := TIME();  // Get the current system time
    TimeElapsed := CurrentTime - StartTime;  // Calculate the elapsed time

    IF TimeElapsed >= Duration THEN
        // Timer has elapsed
        Elapsed := TRUE;
        TimeLeft := T#0s;  // No time left
        TimerActive := FALSE;  // Stop the timer
    ELSE
        // Timer is still running
        Elapsed := FALSE;
        TimeLeft := Duration - TimeElapsed;  // Calculate the remaining time
    END_IF;
END_IF;

// Store the current Start state
PreviousStart := Start;

END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```

Key Features:

	1.	Configurable Duration:
	•	Duration: The timer duration is configured using the IEC 61131-3 TIME data type (e.g., T#5s for 5 seconds).
	2.	Start/Stop Controls:
	•	Start: Starts the timer when a rising edge is detected (i.e., Start transitions from FALSE to TRUE).
	•	Stop: Immediately stops the timer and resets it.
	3.	Timeout Handling:
	•	The timer checks if the elapsed time has reached the Duration. When it does, it sets Elapsed to TRUE and stops itself.
	4.	Output Signals:
	•	Elapsed: Indicates whether the timer has reached its configured duration.
	•	TimeLeft: Displays the remaining time until the timer reaches its configured duration.
	5.	Internal Variables:
	•	TimerActive: Keeps track of whether the timer is currently running.
	•	StartTime: Captures the start time when the timer begins.
	•	TimeElapsed: Keeps track of the elapsed time since the timer started.
