The following program implements a sequential control system for the batch production of polyvinylchloride (PVC) using the ISA-88 control recipe structure. It consists of three primary stages: Polymerize, Decover, and Dry. Each stage contains a set of ordered operations to ensure the safe and efficient production of PVC.

Program Structure Overview

	1.	ISA-88 Control Recipe Structure:
	•	Process Cell: PVC_Reactor
	•	Unit Procedures:
	1.	Polymerize: Prepare the reactor, evacuate, charge, react.
	2.	Decover: Vent gases, drain.
	3.	Dry: Remove residual moisture.
	2.	Operations and Phases:
	•	EvacuateReactor: Remove oxygen to create an inert environment.
	•	AddDemineralizedWater: Charge the reactor with water and surfactants.
	•	React: Add vinyl chloride monomer and catalyst, and control the reaction temperature and pressure.
	3.	Key Method Implementation:
	•	Functions like EvacuateReactor and AddDemineralizedWater manage precise timing and process parameters.

ISA-88 Application in Recipe Structuring

The program follows the ISA-88 batch control model principles by breaking down the process into unit procedures, operations, and phases:

	•	Stages as Unit Procedures: Each stage (e.g., Polymerize, Decover, and Dry) is represented as a distinct procedure, ensuring clear separation and modularity.
	•	Phases for Operations: Phases like EvacuateReactor, AddDemineralizedWater, and React are defined as individual operations, providing a structured sequence of process steps.
	•	Parameterization and Reusability: The use of functions with process-specific parameters (e.g., PT values for timers) ensures that the control recipe can be scaled or adapted for different reactor sizes or production rates.

Challenges in Scaling for Industrial Use

	1.	Reactor Size Variability: The parameters (e.g., evacuation and reaction times) need to be recalibrated for larger reactors.
	2.	Temperature Control Accuracy: Precise control loops for heating and cooling require tuning for industrial-scale operations.
	3.	Safety Considerations: Automated interlocks for abnormal pressure and temperature conditions must be integrated to prevent unsafe conditions.
	4.	ISA-88 Recipe Management: Handling multiple batches simultaneously requires an extension of this model to manage multiple instances of the control recipe.

This structured approach using IEC 61131-3 and ISA-88 ensures both process clarity and flexibility, making it suitable for scaling to larger systems.
