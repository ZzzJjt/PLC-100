The code provided implements a Cascade Control System using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST). Cascade control involves using two separate Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers, where the output of the primary controller becomes the setpoint for the secondary controller. In this context:

	•	Primary Loop: Regulates vessel pressure (the main process variable, PV1).
	•	Secondary Loop: Controls flow rate (PV2) by adjusting the control valve position (OP2).

**1. Variable Declarations (VAR Section):**

This section defines the variables used in both the primary and secondary control loops, including the process variables, setpoints, outputs, and PID control parameters.

	•	Primary Loop Variables:
	•	PV1: The process variable for the primary loop (vessel pressure).
	•	SP1: The setpoint for the primary loop (target vessel pressure).
	•	OP1: The output of the primary loop, which becomes the setpoint (SP2) for the secondary loop.
	•	Kp1, Ki1, Kd1: PID gains for the primary loop.
	•	e1, e1_prev, e1_sum, e1_diff: Error, previous error, cumulative sum of errors (integral), and error difference (derivative).
	•	Secondary Loop Variables:
	•	PV2: The process variable for the secondary loop (flow rate).
	•	SP2: The setpoint for the secondary loop (provided by OP1).
	•	OP2: The output of the secondary loop, which controls the valve position.
	•	Kp2, Ki2, Kd2: PID gains for the secondary loop.
	•	e2, e2_prev, e2_sum, e2_diff: Error, previous error, cumulative sum of errors (integral), and error difference (derivative).
	•	Time Variables:
	•	dt: The sample time for each control cycle, set to 100 milliseconds.
	•	t_last: Keeps track of the last time the control loop was executed.

**2. Main Control Logic (METHOD RunCascadeControl):**

The RunCascadeControl method performs the cascade control operation. It reads the current process values, calculates the PID control outputs, and updates the setpoints and outputs accordingly.

Step-by-Step Execution:

	1.	Read Current Values:
	•	PV1 is assigned the current pressure value from ReadPressure().
	•	PV2 is assigned the current flow rate value from ReadFlowRate().
	2.	Primary Loop - Pressure Control:
	•	Error Calculation: e1 is calculated as the difference between the setpoint (SP1) and the process variable (PV1).
	•	Integral Term: e1_sum accumulates the error over time (e1_sum + e1 * dt).
	•	Derivative Term: e1_diff is calculated as the rate of change of error over time.
	•	PID Output: OP1 is calculated using the PID formula:

OP1 = Kp1 \times e1 + Ki1 \times e1\_sum + Kd1 \times e1\_diff

	•	Store Previous Error: e1_prev is updated to the current error value (e1).
	•	Output Limiting: Ensures that OP1 stays within a valid range (0.0 to 100.0). This prevents the primary output from exceeding the set boundaries:

 ```
IF OP1 > 100.0 THEN OP1 := 100.0;
ELSIF OP1 < 0.0 THEN OP1 := 0.0;
END_IF;
 ```

**3.	Secondary Loop - Flow Control:**
	•	Setpoint Update: The secondary setpoint (SP2) is set to the primary output (OP1).
	•	Error Calculation: e2 is calculated as the difference between SP2 and the process variable (PV2).
	•	Integral Term: e2_sum accumulates the error over time (e2_sum + e2 * dt).
	•	Derivative Term: e2_diff is calculated as the rate of change of error over time.
	•	PID Output: OP2 is calculated using the PID formula:

OP2 = Kp2 \times e2 + Ki2 \times e2\_sum + Kd2 \times e2\_diff

	•	Store Previous Error: e2_prev is updated to the current error value (e2).
	•	Output Limiting: Ensures that OP2 (valve position) stays within a valid range (0.0 to 100.0):
 ```
IF OP2 > 100.0 THEN OP2 := 100.0;
ELSIF OP2 < 0.0 THEN OP2 := 0.0;
END_IF;
 ```

**4.	Set Control Valve Position:**
	•	The output of the secondary loop (OP2) is used to set the position of the control valve using the SetValvePosition(OP2) procedure.

**3. Key Points to Note:**

	•	Primary and Secondary Control Loops:
	•	The primary controller adjusts the secondary setpoint (SP2) based on the error in pressure (e1).
	•	The secondary controller directly controls the valve position (OP2) based on the error in flow rate (e2).
	•	Limiting the Outputs: Both OP1 and OP2 are limited to a range of 0.0 to 100.0, ensuring safe operation of the control system.
	•	Sample Time (dt) and Timing: The code uses a sample time of 100 ms, indicating that the control loop is executed at this interval.
