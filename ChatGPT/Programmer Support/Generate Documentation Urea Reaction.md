The UreaReactionControl program is designed to automate the control of a chemical reaction process for urea production using ammonia and CO2 as reactants. The program operates in two main steps:

	1.	Loading Raw Materials: Controls the opening of ammonia and CO2 valves to load reactants into the reactor.
	2.	Reaction Control: Monitors and controls the reactor pressure and temperature to ensure safe and efficient reaction conditions until the reaction time is complete.

Once the reaction is complete, the program automatically shuts off all valves and sets a stReactionFinished flag, indicating the end of the process.

Program Structure

1. Variable Definitions

The program uses a mix of input, output, internal, and parameter variables to track and control the reaction process.

Input Variables

	•	stAmmoniaValve: BOOL
	•	Description: Indicates the status of the ammonia valve. TRUE if the valve is open.
	•	stCO2Valve: BOOL
	•	Description: Indicates the status of the CO2 valve. TRUE if the valve is open.
	•	rCurrentPressure: REAL
	•	Description: Current pressure inside the reactor in bars.
	•	rCurrentTemperature: REAL
	•	Description: Current temperature inside the reactor in degrees Celsius.

Output Variables

	•	stAmmoniaValveControl: BOOL
	•	Description: Control signal to open (TRUE) or close (FALSE) the ammonia valve.
	•	stCO2ValveControl: BOOL
	•	Description: Control signal to open (TRUE) or close (FALSE) the CO2 valve.

Internal Variables

	•	stStep1: BOOL
	•	Description: Step 1 status flag. TRUE if the raw material loading step is complete.
	•	stStep2: BOOL
	•	Description: Step 2 status flag. TRUE if the reaction control step is complete.
	•	stReactionFinished: BOOL
	•	Description: Indicates whether the reaction has finished (TRUE) or not (FALSE).
 
Parameter Variables

	•	rTargetPressure: REAL := 175.0
	•	Description: Target pressure for the reactor in bars.
	•	rPressureTolerance: REAL := 5.0
	•	Description: Acceptable tolerance range for reactor pressure in bars.
	•	rTargetTemperature: REAL := 185.0
	•	Description: Target temperature for the reactor in degrees Celsius.
	•	rTemperatureTolerance: REAL := 2.0
	•	Description: Acceptable tolerance range for reactor temperature in degrees Celsius.
	•	tReactionTime: TIME := T#30m
	•	Description: Total reaction time duration in minutes.
	•	tReactionTimer: TIME
	•	Description: Timestamp to record the start time of the reaction.
