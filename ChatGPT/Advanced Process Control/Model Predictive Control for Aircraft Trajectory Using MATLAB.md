> Develop MATLAB code to implement a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the trajectory of an aircraft. Ensure that the control scheme accounts for dynamic constraints, fuel efficiency, and external disturbances, while maintaining flight safety and performance objectives.

To develop a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing the trajectory of an aircraft in MATLAB, we’ll break it down into key components:

1.	Aircraft Dynamics Model: We will use a simplified longitudinal model that captures the relationship between the aircraft’s position, velocity, and control inputs (thrust, pitch angle).
   
2.	Cost Function: The objective is to minimize fuel consumption, which is influenced by thrust and flight time, while keeping the aircraft within safe operational constraints.

3.	Constraints: These include dynamic constraints (limits on velocity, pitch angle, etc.), safety constraints (altitude, speed limits), and external disturbances like wind or turbulence.

4.	MPC Implementation: MPC will predict the future trajectory over a finite horizon and solve an optimization problem at each time step.

Here’s an outline of the MATLAB code for such an MPC

**Step 1: Define the Aircraft Dynamics Model**
```
function x_dot = aircraft_dynamics(t, x, u, disturbance)
    % x = [altitude; velocity; flight path angle]
    % u = [thrust; pitch angle]
    % disturbance = [wind disturbance; turbulence effect]
    
    g = 9.81;  % Gravity (m/s^2)
    m = 5000;  % Aircraft mass (kg)
    S = 30;    % Wing area (m^2)
    rho = 1.225; % Air density at sea level (kg/m^3)
    CD0 = 0.02; % Drag coefficient at zero lift
    CL = 0.5;   % Lift coefficient (assumed constant)

    % Disturbances
    wind = disturbance(1);  
    turbulence = disturbance(2);
    
    % State variables
    altitude = x(1);  
    velocity = x(2);
    gamma = x(3);  % Flight path angle (radians)

    % Inputs
    thrust = u(1);   
    pitch_angle = u(2);  
    
    % Drag force
    drag = 0.5 * rho * velocity^2 * S * (CD0 + CL^2 / (pi * 10));  % Simplified drag equation
    
    % Aircraft dynamics equations
    x_dot = zeros(3,1);
    x_dot(1) = velocity * sin(gamma); % Altitude rate of change
    x_dot(2) = (thrust - drag) / m - g * sin(gamma); % Velocity rate of change
    x_dot(3) = (thrust * sin(pitch_angle)) / (m * velocity) - g / velocity * cos(gamma); % Flight path angle rate of change

    % Adding external disturbances
    x_dot(2) = x_dot(2) + wind;  % Modify velocity with wind disturbance
    x_dot(3) = x_dot(3) + turbulence;  % Modify angle with turbulence disturbance
end
```

Step 2: MPC Cost Function

The cost function minimizes fuel consumption while considering safety and performance objectives. This is generally formulated as:

$$
J=\sum_{k=0}^N\left(w_1 \cdot \operatorname{fuel}\left(u_k\right)+w_2 \cdot \text { deviation }\left(x_k\right)+w_3 \cdot \text { control } \operatorname{effort}\left(u_k\right)\right)
$$
