> Develop MATLAB code for a mathematical model of a distillation column, capturing its dynamic relationships between feed rates and temperature. Avoid plotting results. Implement a model predictive control (MPC) scheme using the developed model to optimize the distillation process while considering operational constraints.

To model the dynamic behavior of a distillation column in MATLAB and implement Model Predictive Control (MPC), we can follow these steps:

**Step 1: Define the Distillation Column Model**

We will represent the distillation column dynamics using a state-space model that captures the relationship between feed rates and temperature. The model can be derived from first-principles equations or system identification.

For simplicity, let’s assume a linear state-space model in the form:

$$\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)$$

$$y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t)$$

Where:

$$\dot{x}(t)$$ is the state vector (temperatures at different trays).

$$\dot{u}(t)$$ is the control input (feed rates).

$$\dot{y}(t)$$ is the output (distillate and bottom product compositions, or key tray temperatures).

Here is an example MATLAB code for the model:

% Distillation column model parameters (assumed values)
A = [-0.5, 0.1; 0.05, -0.3]; % System matrix
B = [0.2; 0.1];               % Input matrix
C = [1, 0];                   % Output matrix (measure temperature of tray 1)
D = 0;                        % Direct transmission

% Continuous-time state-space model
sys = ss(A, B, C, D);

% Discretize the model for use in MPC (sample time Ts = 1 sec)
Ts = 1;
sys_d = c2d(sys, Ts);

% Define constraints (operational limits)
u_min = 0;     % Minimum feed rate
u_max = 1;     % Maximum feed rate
y_min = 100;   % Minimum temperature (operational lower bound)
y_max = 200;   % Maximum temperature (operational upper bound)

% Initial state of the system
x0 = [150; 120]; % Initial tray temperatures

**Step 2: Implement Model Predictive Control (MPC)**

Next, we implement MPC using the discretized model. The controller will optimize the control inputs to minimize a cost function while considering constraints on the input and output.

Here’s an example of the MPC implementation:

% Define the MPC controller
mpcobj = mpc(sys_d, Ts);

% Prediction horizon and control horizon
mpcobj.PredictionHorizon = 10; % Predict over 10 steps
mpcobj.ControlHorizon = 2;     % Optimize over the next 2 steps

% Constraints on the control input (feed rate) and output (temperature)
mpcobj.MV.Min = u_min;
mpcobj.MV.Max = u_max;
mpcobj.OV.Min = y_min;
mpcobj.OV.Max = y_max;

% Weights for the cost function (minimize output deviations and control effort)
mpcobj.Weights.ManipulatedVariables = 0.1;  % Penalize large control moves
mpcobj.Weights.ManipulatedVariablesRate = 0.01; % Penalize rate of change
mpcobj.Weights.OutputVariables = 1;  % Emphasize tracking of temperature setpoint

% Simulation parameters
Tf = 50;  % Simulation duration (50 seconds)
r = 180 * ones(Tf, 1);  % Setpoint for the temperature (180 degrees)

% Simulate the closed-loop system
x = x0;  % Initial state
u = zeros(Tf, 1);  % Control inputs
y = zeros(Tf, 1);  % Outputs (tray temperatures)

for k = 1:Tf
    % Compute the optimal control action using MPC
    u(k) = mpcmove(mpcobj, x, r(k));

    % Simulate the system's response to the control input
    x = A * x + B * u(k);  % Update states (continuous model)
    y(k) = C * x + D * u(k);  % Compute output (tray temperature)
end

% Display the results
fprintf('Final output temperature: %.2f\n', y(Tf));
fprintf('Final feed rate: %.2f\n', u(Tf));

**Explanation:**

	1.	Model Definition: We define a simple state-space model of the distillation column, focusing on temperatures and feed rates.
	2.	MPC Controller Setup: The MPC controller is configured with prediction and control horizons, cost function weights, and input/output constraints.
	3.	Simulation Loop: The system is simulated over a time horizon T_f, where the MPC controller calculates optimal feed rates at each time step to minimize deviations from the desired temperature setpoint.

This code avoids plotting but simulates the system to show the final feed rate and temperature. You can modify the model parameters, constraints, and cost function weights based on the specific dynamics of your distillation column model.
