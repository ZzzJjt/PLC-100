The following is a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for implementing feedforward control to manage the mixing of two reactants in a chemical process. The program calculates the necessary flow rate adjustments for each reactant based on changes in input conditions such as flow rates, concentration, and temperature, ensuring optimal mixing without relying solely on feedback.

Program Explanation

	1.	Process Variables: The program defines variables for flow rates, concentrations, and temperatures of Reactants A and B.
	2.	Desired Process Conditions: The target concentration and total flow rate of the mixed solution are specified.
	3.	Feedforward Control Calculations:
	•	Concentration Factors: Calculated based on the ratio of desired mixture concentration to individual reactant concentrations.
	•	Temperature Factors: Adjustments are made for reactant temperatures above a set threshold (e.g., 25°C), to account for the impact of temperature on reaction rates.
	4.	Adjusted Flow Rates: Feedforward logic calculates the required flow rates for Reactant A and Reactant B to achieve the desired mixture properties.
	5.	Operational Limits: The flow rates are constrained within defined operational limits to ensure safe and stable operation.
	6.	Output: The FlowControlOutput_A and FlowControlOutput_B variables represent the final flow rates, which would be sent to control valves in a real system.
