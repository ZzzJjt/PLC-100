The following is a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for implementing ratio control to mix two reactants (Reactant A and Reactant B) in a 2:1 ratio. The program dynamically adjusts the flow rates of the reactants to ensure that for every two parts of Reactant A, one part of Reactant B is added, maintaining the desired chemical composition.

Program Explanation

	1.	Process Variables: The program defines variables for the measured flow rates of Reactant A and Reactant B.
	2.	Desired Ratio: The program maintains a ratio of 2:1 (Reactant A to Reactant B). This ratio can be adjusted as needed for different processes.
	3.	Ratio Control Calculations:
	•	Desired Flow Rates: DesiredFlowRate_A is calculated as twice the flow rate of Reactant B, and DesiredFlowRate_B is calculated based on the flow rate of Reactant A divided by 2.
	•	Ratio Error: The program computes the ratio error to determine whether the flow of Reactant A is too high or too low relative to Reactant B.
	4.	Flow Adjustment Logic: The program adjusts the flow rate of Reactant A based on the ratio error, ensuring the actual flow rates converge to the desired 2:1 ratio.
	5.	Flow Rate Limits: The program enforces minimum and maximum flow rate limits for safety and operational stability.
	6.	Output: The FlowControlOutput_A and FlowControlOutput_B variables represent the final flow rates for the two reactants, which would be sent to flow control valves or pumps in a real system.
