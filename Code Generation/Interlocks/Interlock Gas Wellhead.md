Below is the implementation of an emergency interlock system for a subsea gas wellhead using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. The program monitors critical parameters such as wellhead pressure, temperature, and flow rates using appropriate transmitters. If any of these parameters exceed predefined safety limits, it initiates an emergency shutdown by closing the master valve (MV-101). It also includes logic for manual reset requirements to prevent automatic restarts after an emergency shutdown, ensuring that the system can only be restarted by a human operator.

**Program Explanation**

	1.	Input Variables:
	•	WellheadPressure: Monitors the current pressure at the subsea wellhead.
	•	WellheadTemperature: Monitors the current temperature at the wellhead.
	•	WellheadFlowRate: Monitors the flow rate through the wellhead, detecting potential leaks.
	•	MasterValveCommand: Command input to open or close the master valve (MV-101).
	•	ManualReset: Input to manually reset the system after an emergency shutdown.
	2.	Output Variables:
	•	MasterValveStatus: Indicates whether the master valve is open (TRUE) or closed (FALSE).
	•	EmergencyShutdown: Indicates if an emergency shutdown has been triggered (TRUE).
	3.	Constant Safety Limits:
	•	HighPressureLimit: Maximum allowable wellhead pressure (1500 psi). Exceeding this value triggers an emergency shutdown.
	•	LowFlowLimit: Minimum flow rate through the wellhead (10 m³/h). A drop below this limit indicates a potential leak.
	•	HighTemperatureLimit: Maximum allowable wellhead temperature (120°C). Exceeding this value triggers an emergency shutdown.
	4.	Interlock Logic:
	•	The program continuously monitors the wellhead pressure, temperature, and flow rate.
	•	If any of these parameters exceed the predefined safety limits, the interlock system initiates an emergency shutdown by setting EmergencyShutdown to TRUE and closing the master valve (MV-101).
	•	When in an emergency shutdown state, the master valve remains closed, and no further operation is permitted until the condition is manually reset.
	5.	Manual Reset Requirement:
	•	Once the EmergencyShutdown is triggered, the system requires a manual reset (ManualReset := TRUE) to clear the emergency state.
	•	This prevents the interlock from automatically resetting, ensuring that human intervention is required to verify safe conditions before restarting the system.


**Role of Emergency Interlocks in Subsea Gas Wellhead Operations**

	1.	Preventing Catastrophic Failures:
	•	Subsea gas wellheads operate under extreme pressure and temperature conditions. Any deviation from safe operating limits can result in catastrophic failures, including blowouts, equipment damage, and environmental disasters.
	•	The interlocks for high pressure, low flow, and high temperature ensure that hazardous situations are detected early, and the system is safely shut down before a failure occurs.
	2.	Leak Detection and Response:
	•	The low flow rate interlock is crucial for detecting leaks, as a sudden drop in flow rate could indicate a rupture in the wellhead or piping.
	•	By closing the master valve immediately, the system isolates the affected section, minimizing gas loss and potential contamination of the surrounding environment.
	3.	Managing Thermal Risks:
	•	High temperatures can lead to thermal expansion, loss of mechanical integrity, or even ignition of gas in extreme cases.
	•	The interlock for high temperature prevents these scenarios by shutting down the system if the temperature exceeds the safety limit.
	4.	Ensuring Human Oversight:
	•	Automatic reset prevention is a critical safety feature. It ensures that, after an emergency shutdown, the system cannot restart without human intervention.
	•	This manual reset requirement allows operators to thoroughly assess the cause of the shutdown, inspect equipment, and verify that it is safe to resume operations.
	5.	Enhancing Environmental and Personnel Safety:
	•	Subsea operations involve complex equipment that is difficult to access and monitor. Emergency interlocks provide an additional layer of safety by automatically responding to hazardous conditions.
	•	These interlocks protect not only the wellhead equipment but also personnel and the environment by preventing uncontrolled releases of gas or other hazardous materials.
