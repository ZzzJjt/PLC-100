Below is the implementation of a structured text program for a pressure relief interlock system using the IEC 61131-3 standard. This program monitors the pressure in a vessel using a pressure sensor (Pressure_Sensor) and triggers a pressure relief valve (Relief_Valve) to open when the pressure exceeds a predefined safe limit (High_Pressure_Setpoint). It also includes fault handling for both sensor and valve malfunctions to ensure that the system defaults to a safe state.

**Program Logic Explanation**

	1.	Pressure Monitoring and Interlock Activation:
	•	The program continuously monitors the pressure inside the vessel using the Pressure_Sensor variable.
	•	When the pressure reaches or exceeds the High_Pressure_Setpoint (set to 10.0 Bar), the interlock is activated (Interlock_Active := TRUE).
	•	The relief valve (Relief_Valve) is opened immediately to relieve excess pressure and prevent overpressure hazards.
	2.	Interlock Reset Condition:
	•	The interlock will not reset until the pressure drops below the Safe_Pressure_Reset threshold (set to 8.0 Bar).
	•	The reset condition also checks for the absence of sensor (Sensor_Fault) or valve (Valve_Fault) faults and requires a manual reset (Manual_Reset := TRUE) to prevent automatic reactivation without operator confirmation.
	3.	Fail-Safe Mechanism:
	•	If either the sensor or valve detects a fault, the interlock remains engaged, and the relief valve is opened to default the system to a safe state.
	•	Manual intervention is required to reset the interlock after clearing the fault.
	4.	Manual Reset:
	•	The program requires a Manual_Reset to be triggered after safe conditions are restored, adding an additional safety layer to ensure that the system is not reset automatically.

**Significance of Pressure Relief Systems in Industrial Safety**

Pressure relief systems are essential components of industrial process safety, designed to protect equipment and personnel from the dangers of overpressure. In the context of high-pressure vessels, pipelines, or reactors, overpressure can occur due to process upsets, equipment malfunctions, or operator errors, leading to potentially catastrophic failures.
