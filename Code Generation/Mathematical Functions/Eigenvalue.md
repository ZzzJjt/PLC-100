Implementing a full-scale eigenvalue computation for a 10x10 matrix in IEC 61131-3 is challenging due to the complexity and precision required. The most common methods for eigenvalue calculation involve iterative techniques such as the QR Algorithm or the Power Iteration Method, which may not be feasible in real-time PLC applications due to the intensive matrix operations involved. Below is a simplified implementation using the Power Iteration Method to compute the largest eigenvalue of a given 10x10 matrix. This implementation is more practical for a PLC environment.

**Power Iteration Method:**

The Power Iteration method is used to find the dominant eigenvalue (the eigenvalue with the largest magnitude) of a matrix. It works by repeatedly multiplying a randomly initialized vector by the matrix until convergence.

**Explanation:**

	1.	Input Variables:
	•	Matrix: The 10x10 input matrix for which the dominant eigenvalue is to be calculated.
	•	Tolerance: The tolerance level for convergence (default set to 1e-6).
	•	MaxIterations: The maximum number of iterations to perform.
	2.	Output Variables:
	•	Eigenvalue: Stores the calculated largest eigenvalue.
	•	Converged: A flag indicating whether the method converged within the given tolerance and maximum iterations.
	3.	Local Variables:
	•	Vector and NextVector: Arrays to store the current and next iteration vectors.
	•	Norm: The Euclidean norm of the vector, used for normalization.
	•	LambdaPrev and LambdaCurrent: Variables to track successive eigenvalue estimates.
	•	Difference: Difference between successive eigenvalue estimates, used for checking convergence.
	4.	Algorithm Steps:
	•	Step 1: Initialize the Vector with random values (in this case, 1.0 for simplicity).
	•	Step 2: Repeatedly multiply the matrix by the vector, normalize the result, and estimate the eigenvalue using the dot product until the difference between successive eigenvalues is below the Tolerance level or the maximum iterations are reached.
	•	Step 3: Set the output Eigenvalue and the Converged flag.
