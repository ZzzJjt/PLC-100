Implementing a full-scale linear programming solver using the Simplex Method in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text is complex due to the matrix operations and iterative nature of the algorithm. Below is a simplified implementation for solving small linear programming problems. This function block is designed to handle a limited number of constraints and variables, making it suitable for optimization tasks in PLC environments.

This implementation uses a simplified tableau-based approach for a problem with a maximum of 3 variables and 3 constraints. Extending this to larger problems would require additional optimization for memory and processing time.

Explanation:

	1.	Input Variables:
	•	C: Coefficients of the objective function. The first 3 elements are the coefficients of the variables, and the 4th element is the Z value.
	•	A: Coefficient matrix for constraints, including the RHS values.
	•	MaxIterations: Limits the number of iterations to avoid infinite loops.
	2.	Output Variables:
	•	X: Solution values for the decision variables.
	•	OptimalValue: The optimal value of the objective function.
	•	Converged: Flag indicating whether an optimal solution was found.
	•	Error: Flag indicating errors such as an unbounded solution.
	3.	Algorithm Steps:
	•	Step 1: Initialize the tableau with the objective function and constraint coefficients.
	•	Step 2: Run the Simplex iterations until the optimal solution is found or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
	•	Step 3: Extract the solution values and the optimal value of the objective function.
