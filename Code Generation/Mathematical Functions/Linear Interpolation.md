Structured Text Implementation for Linear Interpolation

Here’s a self-contained function block for performing linear interpolation in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text. This function block computes an interpolated value for a given input X based on two points (X0, Y0) and (X1, Y1) using the standard linear interpolation formula:

Linear Interpolation Formula:

Y = Y_0 + \frac{(Y_1 - Y_0)}{(X_1 - X_0)} \times (X - X_0)

This formula assumes that X lies between X0 and X1. The result, Y, is the interpolated value corresponding to X.

(* Step 1: Error Handling for Division by Zero *)
    IF X0 = X1 THEN
        Error := TRUE;     (* Set error flag if X0 = X1, as this would result in division by zero *)
        Y := 0.0;          (* Assign a default value to Y in case of error *)
    ELSE
        Error := FALSE;    (* Clear error flag *)
        
        (* Step 2: Calculate Slope (Y1 - Y0) / (X1 - X0) *)
        Slope := (Y1 - Y0) / (X1 - X0); 
        
        (* Step 3: Compute the Interpolated Value Using the Formula *)
        Y := Y0 + Slope * (X - X0); 
    END_IF;

Explanation:

	1.	Input Variables:
	•	X: The X-coordinate for which the interpolated Y value is to be computed.
	•	X0: The X-coordinate of the first known point.
	•	Y0: The Y-coordinate of the first known point.
	•	X1: The X-coordinate of the second known point.
	•	Y1: The Y-coordinate of the second known point.
	2.	Output Variables:
	•	Y: The computed interpolated Y value.
	•	Error: A boolean flag indicating if an error occurred (e.g., division by zero or out-of-bound conditions).
  3.	Local Variables:
	•	Slope: The slope of the line between the two points, calculated as (Y1 - Y0) / (X1 - X0).
