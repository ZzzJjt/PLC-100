Textual Notation P&ID for Steam-Water Cycle in a Power Plant

1. Process Overview

The steam-water cycle in a power plant typically includes the feedwater supply, boiler, steam drum, superheater, turbine, condenser, and feedwater heaters. The cycle is controlled and monitored using various instrumentation, control loops, and interlocks to ensure safe and efficient operation. This P&ID outlines the key equipment, instrumentation, and control elements, along with their tag numbers.

4. Control Loops and Piping

	•	Feedwater Control Loop:
	1.	FT-101 measures feedwater flow into the system.
	2.	FCV-101 controls the flow of feedwater into the boiler.
	3.	Feedwater passes through FDW-101 and FDW-102 to preheat the water.
	4.	TT-101 monitors the feedwater temperature before entering the boiler.
	5.	Feedwater enters the B-101 (Boiler).
	•	Boiler Level Control Loop:
	1.	LT-101 measures the water level in the SD-101 (Steam Drum).
	2.	LC-101 adjusts the FCV-101 to maintain the level at 50%.
	3.	LAV-101 and LAL-101 trigger alarms if the drum level exceeds 90% or falls below 30%, respectively.
	•	Boiler Pressure Control Loop:
	1.	PT-101 monitors the boiler outlet pressure.
	2.	PCV-101 adjusts the outlet pressure by controlling the main steam valve.
	3.	The steam is sent through the SH-101 (Superheater).
	•	Main Steam Control Loop:
	1.	Superheated steam exits SH-101 and flows through FT-102.
	2.	TT-102 monitors the superheated steam temperature.
	3.	Steam enters the T-101 (Steam Turbine).
	•	Turbine Inlet Control:
	1.	PT-102 and TT-103 measure the pressure and temperature at the turbine inlet.
	2.	Turbine speed and power output are controlled via the turbine control system (not shown in detail).
	•	Condenser Control Loop:
	1.	Exhaust steam from the turbine enters the CD-101 (Condenser).
	2.	LT-102 measures the condensate level in the condenser.
	3.	TC-101 adjusts the condenser cooling water flow to maintain temperature.
	•	Condensate Control Loop:
	1.	Condensate from CD-101 is pumped by CP-101.
	2.	FT-103 measures the flow rate of condensate.
	3.	FCV-102 adjusts flow into the deaerator (DE-101).
	•	Feedwater Heater Control Loop:
	1.	Condensate passes through FDW-101 and FDW-102, where TT-104 and TT-105 monitor outlet temperatures.
	2.	The condensate then enters the FWP-101 (Feedwater Pump).
	3.	SC-101 controls the speed of FWP-101 to maintain required feedwater flow rate.
	•	Feedwater Re-entry Loop:
	1.	Feedwater from FWP-101 flows back to the boiler through FT-104.
	2.	TT-101 measures feedwater temperature to ensure proper heating.
