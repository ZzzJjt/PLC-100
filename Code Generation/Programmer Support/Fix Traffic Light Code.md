Key Issues:

	1.	Infinite WHILE Loop: An infinite WHILE loop (WHILE TRUE DO) should not be used without proper termination conditions. It’s more appropriate to use a cyclic task structure or a state machine logic that doesn’t hang in a single WHILE loop.
	2.	Timers Not Properly Reset: The timer (timer) is not being reset correctly in some conditions. This may lead to timing issues.
	3.	Missing Semicolons and Syntax Errors: There are missing semicolons (;) after some statements, which is necessary in structured text.
	4.	Incorrect Function Syntax: The function syntax (FUNCTION and PROCEDURE) needs to be adjusted as per standard ST function and function block definitions.
	5.	Improper Wait Instruction: The WAIT statement is not valid in standard structured text. This should be replaced with logic that waits for the condition using flags or timers.

Key Changes Explained:

	1.	Replaced the Infinite WHILE TRUE DO Loop: Structured text is typically run in a cyclic task environment, where WHILE TRUE DO is not necessary. Removed the loop to fit the standard cyclic behavior.
	2.	Timer Initialization and Control: Adjusted the timer(IN, PT) assignments to correctly control the timing based on light transitions.
	3.	State Management for Lights: Implemented a clear transition between green, yellow, and red lights using IF statements to ensure predictable behavior.
	4.	Polling for Pedestrian Button: Removed WAIT UNTIL and replaced it with a simple polling mechanism (IF NOT ReadPedestrianButton()).
